React. Redux. React Router.

# what is this?
This is an attempt to create a self-documenting, comentless codebase on which a developer can build a webapp using aformentioned technologies.

The philosophy is to keep dependencies to a minimum and instead use low-level components and knit them together using pure javascript. That is to say: no task runner, no webpack-dev-server (I'm using the middleware component and the express server).
